Here we include the analysis of empirical data. The dataset can be downloaded from:

Note: Data in the HOTS in early years were not as reliable as in more recent years due to the improvement in the performance of the flow cytometer now used to detect microbes at Station ALOHA.

The main file to run are:
bermuda_example.r
hawaii_example.r
